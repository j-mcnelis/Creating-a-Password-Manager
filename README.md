# Secure Credential Management System

## Objective

This project will be focusing on creating a secure credential management system. It will mainly be focused on both security and funcitonality with less emphasis on the actual user interface. My original plan was to create a password manager but I think it aligns more with a secure credential management system. One main goal of this project is to improve/showcase my security engineering skillset.
