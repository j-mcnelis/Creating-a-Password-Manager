# Creating-a-Password-Manager

## Objective

This project will be focusing on creating a password manager that will salt passwords and encrypt data at rest. It will mainly be focused on both security and funcitonality with less emphasis on the actual user interface. As the project progresses, I may attempt to integrate a logging system that will track when an account is created, edited, or viewed that will integrate with Splunk.
